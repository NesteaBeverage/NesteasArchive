            <h2>A little about me...</h2>
            <p> Im currently in my 4th year in Mechanical Engineering At Ryerson University,
                whilst starting a minor in computer science. I've experienced coding with languages
                such as Python, C, and Java. Im familiar with prototyping using Arduino IDE and 
                have a bit of knowledge with and have access to a handful of manufacturing tools.
                However I do think I can do a better job with welding hahaha. I occasionally design 3D printed 
                models for fun, some of which are featured <a href="3dfiles.html">here.<a>
